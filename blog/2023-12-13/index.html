  Hey Guys
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2023-12-13</strong></p>
<p>wassup it's me [A2], I felt like writing a blog post for here becuase why not. <br>
Wrath development is goin. I personally haven't done much lately but I got a bit burnt out I did a lot of work lately so I took a break. But I am getting back into the swing of things, bugfixing, adding new sprites. <br>
Still gotta get to work on Gatekeepers but yknow we don't talk about it....... <br>
Other than that v2 dev is going well and most of everything is almost in a 100% playable state. which is exciting!!! playtesting time is upon us soon!! <br>
Anyways that's all for now. Get ready for new stuff on the site, and if you're here, that's pretty cool. <br>
ok [A2] out</p>
